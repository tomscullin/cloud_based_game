# 🌩️ Cloud Based

Welcome to **Cloud Based** — a text-based dystopian simulation where your soul has been uploaded to the cloud… but you’re stuck on the **Free Plan**.

In this game, you’ll experience the existential joy of:

- Limited storage for your memories
- Constant ads playing in your subconscious
- Family members debating whether to keep paying your subscription
- A hyper-capitalist digital afterlife where even your personality is monetized

Your goal is simple:
**Stay online without losing your humanity (or your subscription).**  
But remember — in capitalism, even "winning" might be losing.

## 🚀 Current Status

This is an early-stage proof of concept built in **Python**.  
Right now, it’s just a simple text-based prototype, but it will grow over time into a narrative management game with multiple story arcs, branching endings, and existential dread baked in.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

**Beginner Version:**

```bash
cloud_based/
├── main.py        # Game logic (currently minimal)
└── README.md      # You’re reading it!
```

As the project grows, it will expand to include:

- Player stats
- Event systems
- Story content files
- Game loop modules
- Save/load functionality
